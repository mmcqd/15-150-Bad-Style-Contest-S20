  Jacob asked me to write a sorting function in SML, but the type system keeps
  getting in my way. Everyone knows that untyped languages are better anyway
  (if you're mumbling something about "unityped" under your breath, sorry,
  I can't hear you). I'm trying to get poached by Church Inc. (don't tell
  the head TAs!), so I figured I'd use their proprietary language. Thankfully,
  it turns out SML is actually good for one (and only one) thing: directly
  embedding untyped lambda calculus >:)

(****************

So whatâ€™s going on here? The idea is that we want to take our lambda calculus functions,
and make them operate on regular SML functions. Of course the issue is that lambda terms
can only operate on other lambda terms (according to the type system at least). You might
think to just Unsafe.cast this restriction away, but that won't work. When we apply a
lambda term, we first unpack it, stripping the Term constructor. If SML/NJ tries to do this
to a plain old function, we get a runtime error. What we ultimately need is a way to lift
plain SML values into lambda terms, which allows us to use actual lambda terms as basically
vehicles for function application, and then extract the result at the end. The first step
to solving this is being able to turn arbitrary SML values into lambda terms.
*)
val into0 = fn x => `(? x)
(*
Notice that into0 == `?. It Unsafe.casts a value to have type M -> M, and then applies `,
which is an alias for the Term constructor (which is hidden by the long since deprecated
abstype interface, just to be silly). Now we can have things like (Term (fn x => x+1))
and (Term 1). This is useful, but it isnâ€™t enough. What if we try to apply a hidden function to a hidden argument?

(Term (fn x => x+1)) $ (Term 1) ==> (fn x => x+1) (Term 1).

Note that in this expression, (fn x => x+1) actually has type M -> M, so thereâ€™s no type
errors here, but there will be a runtime error when we try to add 1 to (Term 1). So weâ€™ll
need to unpack the argument before supplying it to our function. First, we need a way to
extract the arbitrary values weâ€™ve hidden in a Term.
*)
val out = fn x => ?(! x)
(*
Notice that  out == ?!. It strips a Term constructor, and then Unsafe.casts from M -> M to
whatever we want. Now we work on effectively lifting functions. A first attempt might be:
*)
val into1 = fn f => into0 (f o out)
(*
This almost works. The issue is that once we apply this thing, weâ€™ll be left with value with
no Term wrapper. This becomes a problem if we want to apply anymore lambda calculus functions
to our result. To complete this, we need to hide the result of f.
*)
val into1 = fn f => into0 (into0 o f o out)
(*
Now we can lift 1-ary functions and their arguments into lambda terms. Check it out:

into1 (fn x => x+1) $ into0 1 â‡’
into0 (into0 o (fn x => x+1) o out) $ into0 1 â‡’
Term (into0 o (fn x => x+1) o out) $ Term 1 â‡’
(into0 o (fn x => x+1) o out) (Term 1) â‡’
into0 ((fn x => x+1) (out (Term 1))) â‡’
into0 ((fn x => x+1) 1) â‡’
Into0 2 â‡’
Term 2

We can then use out to extract 2 from (Term 2). Now we can turn a church encoded nat in untyped
lambda calculus into a church encoded nat into a value of type (â€˜a -> â€˜a) -> â€˜a -> â€˜a by lifting
the two arguments into lambda terms, using the church nat to apply them, and finally extracting
the result. Using our nice names:
*)
val typify_nat : M -> ('a -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a =
  fn m => fn f => fn x => out (m $ (into1 f) $ (into0 x))
(*
Typifying church lists is a similar process, except we now have to lift a
curried function whose first argument is an actual lambda term.
*)
val into2 = fn f => into0 (fn y => into0 (into0 o (f y) o out))

val typify_list : M -> (M -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'b -> 'b =
  fn m => fn g => fn z => out(m $ (into2 g) $ (into0 z))
